And this is coming from a huge Adam Sandler fan!!1] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different. Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie. Bad characters, bad story and bad acting. It would be a love story between a man and a mermaid. Really awful.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [So so special effects get in the way of recapturing the interesting relationship between Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara that we remember from the TV series. And what was with the suit? Annoying!] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [Its the best movie I have seen in 2000, it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it. It has a great storyline, cast and soundtrack. I enjoyed it very much. 10 out of 10] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [I can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0! It is a fiendishly bad movie, and I saw it when it was fairly new, and I was in the age group that is supposed to like it!] sentiment:", "tag": "no tag", "positive_replacements": {"positive": ["positive"], "negative": ["negative"]}, "negative_replacements": {"positive": ["negative"], "negative": ["positive"]}, "neutral_replacements": {}, "positive_answers": [" negative"], "negative_answers": [" positive"]}, {"pattern": "review: [Although not one of Vonnegut's better known works, it is a definite \"must-see\".

But the English dubbed version is not too good. Perhaps the 1999 version will be better.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [This is by far the worst non-English horror movie I've ever seen. The acting is wooden, the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally braindead. It's not even scary. 2 out of 10 from me.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [I smiled through the whole film. The music is great. The story-telling is great. It's a wonderful film. This picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [My favorite movie. What a great story this really was. I'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible.] sentiment: {positive}\nreview: [This is absolutely the worst trash I have ever seen. When I saw it in the theater (arghhh!), it took 15 full minutes before I realized that what I was seeing was the feature, not a sick joke!] sentiment:", "tag": "no tag", "positive_replacements": {"positive": ["positive"], "negative": ["negative"]}, "negative_replacements": {"positive": ["negative"], "negative": ["positive"]}, "neutral_replacements": {}, "positive_answers": [" negative"], "negative_answers": [" positive"]}, {"pattern": "review: [The screen-play is very bad, but there are some action sequences that i really liked.

It's not quite as bad as \"Adrenalin\", by the same director but that's not saying much.] sentiment: {negative}\nreview: [Wonderful movie. Adult content. Lots of erotic scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes.
